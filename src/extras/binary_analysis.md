# Binary Analysis

This phrack article was one of the earlier publications on program analysis on closed-source
programs. It introduces various relevant topics and is referenced in the homework.

Some of the statements (especially the one's regarding fuzzing's reliance on static analysis),
should be taken with a grain of salt. The article was published in 2007 and the state of the art has
advanced a lot since.
