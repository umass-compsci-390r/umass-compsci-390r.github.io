# Project 0

This project is designed to help you set up the reverse engineering tools we are using in this course, and should also help you become familiar with using them. 

**Note: you will need access to a computer that has support for x86 instructions; this is so you can run the program and the tools. M1/M2 Macs and ARM-based processors will very likely not work well, if at all, as there is a different architecture.**
